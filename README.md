## Data Science Foundations - semestral course
Spring semester 2022

The course introduced various statistical methods and the paper on **regression analysis** was made.

The paper on the regression analysis is a great document to discuss. My experience with statistical analysis developed a lot after this course/document was prepared. There are parts in the document that I would approach very differently now. I will be happy to discuss.
